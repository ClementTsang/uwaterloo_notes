\section{Review}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A word is 4 bytes in 32-bit, 8 bytes in 64-bit.  We focus on 32-bit, so 4 byte words.
    \item We use hexadecimal (base 16, 0-9, a-f) for ease of reading and use.
    \item Each hexadecimal character is a nibble.
    \item Prefix with 0x or subscript with 16.
    \item ie: 10011101 $\rightarrow$ 0x9d
    \item Dec $\rightarrow$ Bin - divide by 2 repeatedly.
    \item We use twos complement over signed magnitude for signed numbers due to the latter's issue with double zeros and arithmetic problems.
    \item ASCII is a 7-bit representation of a character.
\end{itemize}
