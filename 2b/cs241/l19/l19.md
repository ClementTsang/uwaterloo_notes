**CS 241, Lecture 19: Code Generation (Part Four)**

Pointers
========

-   So I apparently overstudied$\dots$ again.

    Dereferencing
    -------------

-   For `NULL`, we need to make sure that it points to a
    non-word-aligned address (so not divisible by 4, we use 0x1), so it
    will crash if we dereference it!
