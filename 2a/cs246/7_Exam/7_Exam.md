-   Obviously design patterns. Likely ask you to either write out a
    specific design pattern or ask you one.

-   Using correct visibilities, proper use of friends, proper use of
    abstract/virtual, even if not specifically mentioned.

Review
======

-   Make sure to remember that if you overload the default constructor,
    you must modify it to either have default parameters or not
    accidentally call the default constructor w/o arguments!

        class A {
            public:
            ~A();
        };

        class B : public A {
            public:
            ~B();
        }

        int main() {
            A* a = new B();
            delete a;
        }

-   If we do not use virtual on a function, then when we make a pointer
    that points to a subclass, it will run the function of type
    pointer - NOT the one that we are pointing to. Virtual will invoke
    the proper method for the subclass (IOW, tell the compiler to look
    at the ACTUAL type of the object, NOT the type of the thing that is
    pointing to said object).

        class A {
        };

        class B : public A {
            int d;
        };

        int main() {
            A *a = new B();
            cout << a->d << endl;
        }

-   Remember you cannot access subclass fields with superclass
    variables!

-   Always remember that you cannot call a class that has an abstract
    superclass unless you override ALL pure virtual methods!

-   Note that smart pointers != no memory leaks. For example, let's say
    we had a struct w/ a unique pointer. If we changed it to another
    (unique) pointer, then the memory would be lost! Another possible
    problem is that smart pointers are not exception-safe. If there is a
    problem, it is very possible that the memory is lost when an
    exception is thrown. For example:

        struct A {
            unique_ptr<int> pi;
            unique_ptr<double> pd;
            A(int* pi, double* pd) : pi{pi}, pd{pd}{}
        };

        int main() {
            A a {new int{42}, new double{3.14};
        }

-   If pi works, but, say, pd fails, then pi will be lost.

-   Given the following, rewrite to follow NVI:

        class C_old {
            public:
                void f();
                virtual int g();
                 virtual ~C();
        };
        //////////////////////////////////
        class C_new {
            public:
                void f();
                int g() {
                    return doG();
                }
                virtual ~C();
            private:
                virtual int doG();
        };

-   T/F? In the Observer pattern, should Â Subject() delete all of the
    Subject's observers? ---\> Obviously, this is false. Subject DOES
    NOT OWN ANY OF THE OBSERVERS. Furthermore, we may still need the
    observers to live past the subject. Thus, it is false.

-   Consider the following:

        const int c = 5;
        int main() {
            int *d = const_cast<int*>(&c);
            *d = 10;
            //...
        }

-   What is the behaviour? We realize that this will compile, but not
    run safely (undefined behaviour). This is as we told the compiler
    that d is a pointer to a constant integer that is const\_casted ---
    but in the VERY NEXT LINE, we try to modify the value of what it
    points to!

-   We must realize that const\_cast allows us to make a non-const
    pointer to const values, but we must abide by this ourselves as we
    tell the compiler to basically not worry about this (normally we
    must do const int \*d = c;).

-   Why can unique\_ptrs not be copied? The reason they cannot be copied
    is due to their design - if we copy, then they will share values on
    heap. Deleting one will cause the second one to cause a double-free
    upon its own deletion.

-   Given the following code, is this a valid use of unique\_ptrs?

        class C {...};
        unique_ptr <C> f() {
            //...
            unique_ptr<C> p = make_unique<C> (...);
            //...
            return p;
        }

        int main() {
            unique_ptr<C> q = f();
        }

-   We see that q invokes the move constructor. This is valid! This is
    as when we use move constructor, we DO NOT have two unique\_ptrs
    pointing at the same object, so move is valid! Thus, there are no
    problems with this code.
