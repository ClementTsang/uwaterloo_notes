MC, short answer (most likely concept questions?)

Only one very long coding question. How nice.

Lvalues are values that we can somehow refer to. Typically, if it has a
name associated to it, like "int x", or "int y = x", it is a lvalue.

Rvalues are values that we CANNOT refer to on the LHS. Literals,
functions, etc.

Don't forget that references must be initalized.

Big 5:

-   dtor

-   copy ctor

-   move ctor

-   copy assignment (= override)

-   move assignment
