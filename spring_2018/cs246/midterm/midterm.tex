\begin{document}
\item MC, short answer (most likely concept questions?)
\item Only one very long coding question.  How nice.
\item Lvalues are values that we can somehow refer to.  Typically, if it has a name associated to it, like ``int x'', or ``int y = x'', it is a lvalue.
\item Rvalues are values that we CANNOT refer to on the LHS.  Literals, functions, etc.
\item Don't forget that references must be initalized.
\item Big 5:
\begin{itemize}
\item dtor
\item copy ctor
\item move ctor
\item copy assignment  (= override)
\item move assignment 
\end{itemize}
