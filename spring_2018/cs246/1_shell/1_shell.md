Intro
=====

-   We use computers to do two mechanisms:

    -   Display information

    -   Perform operations

-   We use the shell perform various tasks:

    -   Read commands and interpret them

    -   OS interface that gets the OS to do things.

-   There are 2 main approaches to shells: graphical shell (GUI) versus
    a command shell (CLI)

-   Unix uses two types, both similar/equivalent:

    -   sh (ksh, bash) (what we use)

    -   csh (tcsh)

Linux File System Management
============================

-   / is the root.

-   Typical subdirectories of the root are:

    -   bin (bash, ls), etc (shell)

    -   home (username; files that we create on our account are
        typically stored here).

    -   usr (bin, include, share).

-   Due to Marmoset being fickle, make sure EVERY file ends with a
    newline!

-   If using Vi/Vim, it should do this for you automatically, but double
    check to make sure it fits the project's requests.

-   Absolute path: starts from root, NOT relative from somewhere else -
    thus, it will start from /, and isn't based on where it is called.

-   We note that the shell will mention your absolute path to your
    current directory.

-   Relative path: starts from where it is called.

    -   . represents the current directory

    -   .. represents the parent directory OF the current directory

    -   /\... represents the user home directory

    -   userid/\... represents userid's home directory

-   More useful bash commands:

    -   ls lists all files in current directory We use the -a parameter
        to show hidden files.

    -   mkdir name creates a child directory at your cd

    -   rmdir name deletes a directory, BUT it must be empty.

    -   rm deletes a file or directory. Use the -r parameter
        (recursively deletes) to delete all child files, and the
        directory you specified.

    -   "\*" represents a wildcard, we can use this to take EVERYTHING
        that matches before/after the wildcard character (ie: ls -al
        \*.txt) (aka globbing)

    -   A slightly more difficult example is something like "ls -al
        \*f\*.\*". This would list ALL files, hidden or not, that have
        an 'f' and are files.

    -   "echo TEXT" will output to the console whatever you put after
        it. You could combine this with wildcard --- for example, "echo
        \*.txt\" would print out the file names of all files that are
        txt files. Note "\*.txt" would print out "\*.txt", NOT the
        files!

    -   "?" represents wildcard matching for EACH character. For
        example, let's say we had three folders - CS111, CS 232, CS 246.
        Putting "echo CS???" in bash would output these three folders.
        Basically, it must have the same number of ? as the number of
        characters you are searching for.

    -   On a side note, if echo with ? fails to find anything, then
        it'll just print out the string you were searching for. For
        example, "echo CS?" will output "CS?" if it finds nothing.

    -   xyis a pattern for anything that starts with x or y.

    -   CS{246,1} will look for any file that starts with CS and follows
        246 OR 1. The difference is that doesn't use commas, BUT this
        would be an issue with anything longer than one character.
        requires commas, but works with multicharacter values.

    -   cat filenamedisplays the content of that file if it exists. Use
        the -n argument to number the lines.

    -   Every process we preform is connected to three streams:

    -   stdin (standard input, defaults to the keyboard's input)

    -   stdout (standard output, defaults to the screen)

    -   stderr (default: screen)

    -   Note that cat \< file and cat file HAVE A DIFFERENCE. The former
        is the shell opening it, the latter is cat opening it. We can
        see this by opening two files at once.

    -   We can simulate copying files by doing something like cat f1 \>
        f2 - this is equal, in this case, to cp f1 f2.

    -   Let's say we wanted to redirect the error message of catting a
        non-existant file. We would do NOT cat fake.txt \> res.txt, but
        rather cat fake.txt 2\> res.txt. Note the latter will still
        create res.txt, just not copy the error message to it.

    -   Note that this type of redirection overwrites the file.

    -   We can use head \# file and tail \# file to specify how many
        lines from the top or bottom (respectively) to print.

    -   Piping: It's literally the
        ` thing.  Basically it allows us to use a command on the result of another command, say, head -4 test.txt `{.haskell}
        grep hello

    -   "uniq file.txt" represents omitting adjacent repeating lines.

    -   "sort file.txt" will output a sorted file.txt.

Pattern Matching
================

-   (e)grep -\> extended global regular expression print. Identical to
    grep -e.

-   Format is egrep \[pattern\] \[filename\].

-   A pattern with no special characters (ie; test) will just print out
    all lines with that string. No need for quotations.

-   We can use a pattern like "word1$|$word2" to search for all lines
    with word1 and/or word2.

-   We could extend this - "word(1$|$2)" would do the same as above.

-   Something we could do is "\[Ww\]ord\[12\]" as well, to, say, detect
    both capital and lowercase, and track 1 or 2.

-   .Ì‚..means not.

-   ? means 0 or 1 of any character that is preceding it.

-   \* means 0 or more of any character preceding it.

-   \+ means 1 or more of any character preceding it.

-   . means any non-line-break character (ie: ".+" is any non-empty
    string).

-   \...1,10 would mean 1 to 10 occurances of the character preceding
    it.

-   \^\... (no brackets) means anything that starts with the following
    string.

-   \...\$ matches the end of the line.

-   ie: chmod a=rx filename

-   ie: chmod a+x filename

File Management
===============

-   ls -l will give you a more detailed list of the files within the
    directory.

-   In the first column, we get a 10 bit line showing what each
    file/directory can do.

-   An example would be something like -rw-r--r--, or something of that
    sort.

    -   \- or d means file or directory

    -   : rwx for user (read write execute)

    -   : rwx (group)

    -   : rwx (other)

-   In the second column, we get the owner of the file.

-   Third column is the group.

-   Fourth column is the size in bytes.

-   Fifth is the last modified date.

-   We use chmod to modify permissions:

-   u, g, o, a for group.

-   +, =, - to add, equate, or remove permissions.

-   r, w, x, for read, write, execute.

-   ie: chmod u-w filename

-   We can define variables within the shell. For example, x=1.

-   "echo \$x" will now print 1.

-   In the shell, all these values are of type string.

-   We could save directories: dir=/cs246, for example.

-   "PATH" is a predefined variable that will tells Linux where to
    search for executables.

-   A good practice is to use \$ to fetch the value of a variable.

-   When we create a script, by default, it will NOT have executable
    permissions. We can easily fix this with chmod.

-   Remember to always include "\#!/bin/bash" to indicate that this is a
    bash script.

-   We pass arguments to our scripts using \$1, \$2\...

-   We can use redirect outputs that we do not want to show to the user
    to /dev/null. It's like tmp.

-   By default, if an operation is completed successfully, the command
    line returns 0. If it fails, it returns /!/= 0.

-   We can use this to our adavantage, and create if/else statements.

-   "\$?" holds the status of the most recently executed command line.

-   "-eq" checks for equality with left and right sides.

-   \$\# tells us the number of arguments.

-   -ne is not equal.

-   \$0 represents the command line itself.

-   \<&2 represents stderr.

-   exit x ends the program with code x - 0 represents it exited fine, a
    non-zero value means it failed to run properly.

-   Bash if chain goes like this:

        if [cond]; then CMD
        elif [cond]; then CMD
        else CMD
        fi

-   Bash while loops go like this:

        while [condition]; do
        CMD
        For an accumulator, say, x:  x=\$((x+1))
        done

-   Bash for loops:

        for varname in listname do
        CMD
        done

-   Observe the following shell script:

        #!\bin\bash
        for name in *.cpp; do
            mv ${name} ${name%cpp}cc
        done

-   \${name%cpp}cc produces the value name without the trailing "cpp",
    and then we replace it with "cc".

-   We can create and use functions in scripts.
