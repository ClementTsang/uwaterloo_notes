**CS 241, Lecture 1 - Introduction and Binary Encoding**

Review
======

-   A word is 4 bytes in 32-bit, 8 bytes in 64-bit. We focus on 32-bit,
    so 4 byte words.

-   We use hexadecimal (base 16, 0-9, a-f) for ease of reading and use.

-   Each hexadecimal character is a nibble.

-   Prefix with 0x or subscript with 16.

-   ie: 10011101 $\rightarrow$ 0x9d

-   Dec $\rightarrow$ Bin - divide by 2 repeatedly.

-   We use twos complement over signed magnitude for signed numbers due
    to the latter's issue with double zeros and arithmetic problems.

-   ASCII is a 7-bit representation of a character.
